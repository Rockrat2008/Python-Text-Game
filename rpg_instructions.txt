MONTY PYTHON ADVENTURE RPG INSTRUCTIONS

This is a text based adventure game that will take you on a quest to find the Holy Grail.
During this adventure you will have the opportunity to search for clues and items that you
will ultimately need to successfully find the Holy Grail.

As you explore the different areas, you will have different choices depending on where you are.
There are times you may try to do something and it doesn't work.  This means that perhaps you
are missing an item you need, or perhaps another step needs to be done first before returning
to do this step.

When all the items are found and the steps are completed in the correct order you will complete
your quest and find the Holy Grail.

Good luck and happy questing.
